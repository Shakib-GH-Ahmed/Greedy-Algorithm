TASK-1:

#taken 2 empty lists
    #IN new, only append the first value initially
#sort the lst according to ending time interval
#run a for loop and iterate from 1 to length of the lst
#Inside the loop, it gives a condition that-
    #append the value if end value of new <= start value of lst
    
#Lastly, we print the new list in the output along with the count 'j'


#TASK-2:


#creating a new list taking the length using index-1 form line1
#lst takes the input values and store the sort values
#Taking a count variable for how many list that's appending to the new list and for the output also
#Inside the loop, if it's a empty list we add any of them in the new list.
#breaking the loop to go back the first loop to increase the value of i and iterate again
#At last, we just shows the count value as the output.

#TASK-3:


#arr: Initializes a list called arr with all elements set to 1. 
    # This list will be used to keep track of the size of each group of connected people.
#par = [None] * (no_people + 1): Initializes a list called par with None values.
    #This list will be used to represent the parent of each person in the group.
#function find that takes a person r as an argument and recursively finds their ultimate parent in the group.
#If par[r] is equal to r (i.e., r is its own parent), it returns r.
#Otherwise, it recursively calls the function until it reaches the ultimate parent.
